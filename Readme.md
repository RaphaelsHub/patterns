# Design Patterns Overview

This repository is a categorized collection of classic software design patterns implemented in C#.  
Patterns are grouped into three main categories:

## 🔧 Creational Patterns  
Creational patterns abstract the instantiation process. They help make systems independent of how their objects are created, composed, and represented.

## 🧱 Structural Patterns  
Structural patterns deal with object composition. They help ensure that components are organized efficiently and flexibly to form larger structures.

## 🔁 Behavioral Patterns  
Behavioral patterns focus on the interaction and communication between objects. They define clear responsibilities and improve object cooperation.

Each pattern includes:
- Clear and minimal code example in C#
- Practical context and intent
- When and why to use it

This repository is intended as a learning and reference resource for software engineers exploring classic design approaches.
